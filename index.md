### About Me

Hey there! I'm Wenhao Deng, a tech enthusiast with a keen interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science. I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) with Distinction from the University of Nottingham under the guidance of Dr. Saeid P. Ardakani. Before that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Guangzhou University.

Throughout my learning journey, I've been involved in a variety of projects, such as multi-label text classification with federated learning, Chinese text semantic similarity modeling, distributed parallelization of clustering algorithms, and more. Each project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in different aspects of AI and machine learning.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at wenhao.deng@foxmail.com.
